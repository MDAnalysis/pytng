# TNG Example
made by tng testing code
* directly from API
* 15 particles
* number of steps = 10, stride = 1, number of data frames = 11  
* Positions 

# Argon NPT
argon_npt_compressed.tng system derived from gmx physical validation tests
* run on GMX 2020.2 
* directly from mdrun
* 1000 particles 
* number of steps = 500000, stride = 5000, number of data frames = 101
* Positions, Box Data


# Water NPT Trjconv
water_npt_compressed_trjconv.tng system derived from gmx physical validation tests
* run on GMX 2020.2 
* from mdrun then passed through trjconv
* 2700 particles 
* number of steps = 500000, stride = 5000, number of data frames = 101 
* Positions, Box Data

# Water NPT Forces Vels
water_npt_uncompressed_vels_forces.tng system derived from gmx physical validation tests
* run on GMX 2020.2 
* directly from mdrun
* 2700 particles 
* number of steps = 500000, stride = 5000, number of data frames = 101 
* Positions, Box Data, Forces and Velocities

# test.tng
Coordinates test from MDA, has the same data as test.trr and made using trjconv
NOTE: has strides larger than the number of steps as can happen with trjconv
* number of steps = 5, stride = 100, number of data frames = 0 !!
* Positions, Box Data, Forces, Velocities
