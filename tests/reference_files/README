# TNG Example
made by tng testing code
* directly from API
* 15 particles
* number of steps = 10, stride = 1, number of data frames = 11  
* Positions 

# Argon NPT
argon_npt_compressed.tng system derived from gmx physical validation tests
* run on GMX 2020.2 
* directly from mdrun
* 1000 particles 
* number of steps = 500000, stride = 5000, number of data frames = 101
* Positions, Box Data


# Water NPT Trjconv
water_npt_compressed_trjconv.tng system derived from gmx physical validation tests
